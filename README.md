# Find_maximum_2_integers
 Given two numbers as input, returns the maximum value. Uses a quantum circuit of 2+1 qubits. The code also draws the underlying quantum circuit. 
 Code is compatible with qiskit. 
 Input values can be any type of number -- integers, rational, irrational. The code only depends on the sign of the difference of the two values.
 
 task1_Sanaa.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook (compatbile with qiskit), which has the full code needed to find the maximum. It has necessary comments and there is an option to draw the circuit.
 
 task1_Sanaa_with_more_comments_for_readability.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook (compatbile with qiskit), which has the full code needed to find the maximum. It has additional clarifying comments and includes the drawing of the circuit for improved readability.
