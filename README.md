# Find_maximum_2_integers
 Given two numbers as input, returns the maximum value. Uses a quantum circuit of 2+1 qubits. The code also draws the underlying quantum circuit. 
 Code is compatible with qiskit. 
 Input values can be any type of number -- integers, rational, irrational. The code only depends on the sign of the difference of the two values.
